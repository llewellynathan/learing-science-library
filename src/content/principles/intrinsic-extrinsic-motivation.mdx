## What It Is

Intrinsic motivation refers to doing an activity for its inherent satisfaction—because it's interesting, enjoyable, or meaningful. Extrinsic motivation refers to doing an activity to obtain some separable outcome—a reward, grade, praise, or avoidance of punishment.

Both types of motivation can produce behavior, but they have different effects on the quality of engagement and learning. Intrinsic motivation is associated with deeper processing, greater creativity, better conceptual understanding, and more persistent engagement. Extrinsic motivation can produce compliance and performance, but often with shallower engagement and less persistence once rewards are removed.

The relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is more complex than "intrinsic good, extrinsic bad." Extrinsic motivators can be useful, particularly for tasks that aren't inherently interesting or when building initial engagement. But poorly designed external rewards can "crowd out" intrinsic motivation—a phenomenon called the overjustification effect—making people less likely to engage in the activity without rewards.

## The Research

- **Deci (1971)** demonstrated the overjustification effect: college students who were paid to solve puzzles subsequently spent less free time on puzzles than students who were never paid. The external reward undermined intrinsic interest.

- **Lepper, Greene, & Nisbett (1973)** showed the same effect with children. Those promised awards for drawing spent less time drawing afterward than those who drew without promised rewards.

- **Deci, Koestner, & Ryan (1999)** meta-analyzed 128 studies and found that tangible rewards significantly undermined intrinsic motivation, especially when rewards were expected and contingent on task performance.

- **Cameron, Banko, & Pierce (2001)** argued the picture is more nuanced: rewards undermined intrinsic motivation mainly for initially interesting tasks. For uninteresting tasks, rewards could increase motivation without negative effects.

- **Cerasoli, Nicklin, & Ford (2014)** meta-analyzed the relationship between intrinsic motivation and performance, finding a strong positive relationship (ρ = .26), with intrinsic motivation predicting quality of performance even more than quantity.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Find the fun**: Design activities that are inherently interesting, challenging, or meaningful. Gamification that relies on points and badges without intrinsic interest is fragile.

- **Use rewards carefully**: If using rewards, make them unexpected rather than promised, informational rather than controlling, and avoid them for activities you want learners to do voluntarily.

- **Support competence and autonomy**: Intrinsic motivation flourishes when people feel competent and autonomous. Design for achievable challenges and meaningful choices.

- **Avoid undermining interest**: Be cautious about adding extrinsic rewards to activities learners already find interesting—you may reduce intrinsic motivation.

### For Educators

- **Emphasize meaning over points**: Help students see why material matters, not just what grade they'll get.

- **Provide choice**: When possible, let students choose topics, approaches, or formats. Autonomy supports intrinsic motivation.

- **Use grades carefully**: Grades are extrinsic motivators that can undermine intrinsic interest in learning. Emphasize feedback over evaluation where possible.

- **Model intrinsic interest**: Show your own genuine interest in the subject matter.

### For Self-Learners

- **Connect to personal meaning**: Ask why this learning matters to you personally, beyond external requirements.

- **Find aspects you enjoy**: Even in required learning, look for elements that genuinely interest you.

- **Be cautious with self-rewards**: Promising yourself rewards for studying can backfire, making the studying feel like a chore.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Extrinsic motivation is always bad"**
Extrinsic motivation has its place, especially for activities that aren't inherently interesting, for initial engagement, and when external structures are necessary. The key is using it wisely.

**"Rewards always undermine intrinsic motivation"**
The undermining effect occurs mainly when rewards are expected, tangible, and contingent on performance for initially interesting tasks. Unexpected rewards, informational feedback, and rewards for uninteresting tasks don't show the same negative effects.

**"If something isn't intrinsically motivating, it can't be learned well"**
Extrinsic motivation can support learning, particularly when combined with autonomy-supportive framing. Not everything needs to be intrinsically fascinating; sometimes we learn important things for practical reasons.

**"You can create intrinsic motivation by making activities fun"**
Intrinsic motivation arises from genuine interest, competence, and autonomy—not just from surface-level "fun." Gamification that adds points and badges without addressing these deeper needs typically doesn't create lasting intrinsic motivation.

## Design Considerations

- **Consider initial interest**: For activities learners already find interesting, be very careful with extrinsic rewards. For uninteresting but necessary activities, rewards may be more appropriate.

- **Frame rewards informatively**: Rewards that provide information about competence ("You've mastered this level!") are less harmful than controlling rewards ("Do this to get 50 points").

- **Build in autonomy**: Even within constraints, offer meaningful choices that give learners a sense of ownership.

- **Plan for reward removal**: If you use extrinsic motivators, have a plan for how engagement will continue when rewards are removed.
