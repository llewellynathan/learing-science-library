## What It Is

Self-explanation is the process of generating explanations to yourself about material you're learning. Rather than passively reading or listening, you actively articulate why something is true, how steps in a procedure connect, or what a concept means in your own words.

Research shows that learners who spontaneously self-explain learn more than those who don't, and that prompting self-explanation improves learning even for those who wouldn't do it naturally. Self-explanation works by encouraging deep processing, integrating new information with prior knowledge, and exposing gaps in understanding that passive reading might miss.

Self-explanation is particularly effective when studying worked examples or expository text. When learners explain each step to themselves ("Why did they do this step? How does this connect to what came before?"), they develop deeper understanding than when they simply read through the material.

## The Research

- **Chi et al. (1989)** found that students who spontaneously self-explained while studying physics examples learned more than those who didn't. The amount of self-explanation predicted problem-solving success.

- **Chi et al. (1994)** showed that prompting students to self-explain improved learning from text, particularly for students who wouldn't self-explain spontaneously.

- **VanLehn et al. (1992)** demonstrated that self-explanation helped students learn from worked examples by encouraging them to infer unstated reasons and integrate information across steps.

- **Rittle-Johnson (2006)** found that self-explanation improved procedural learning in mathematics, especially when learners explained both correct procedures and common misconceptions.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Prompt self-explanation**: After presenting information, ask learners to explain it in their own words or explain why it's true.

- **Use "explain this step" prompts**: When presenting worked examples, prompt learners to explain why each step was taken.

- **Include explanation activities**: Build in moments where learners must generate explanations, not just recognize or repeat.

- **Prompt comparisons**: Ask learners to explain how two examples are similar or different—a specific form of self-explanation.

### For Educators

- **Ask "why" and "how" questions**: Prompt students to explain reasoning, not just provide answers.

- **Teach self-explanation as a strategy**: Explicitly teach students to ask themselves why and how questions while studying.

- **Use think-alouds**: Model self-explanation by thinking aloud as you work through examples.

- **Have students explain to each other**: Peer explanation is a form of self-explanation with the added benefit of social accountability.

### For Self-Learners

- **Explain as you read**: Don't just read—stop and explain to yourself what you just read and why it's true.

- **Teach an imaginary student**: Pretend you have to teach the material to someone else. Explaining aloud reveals gaps.

- **Use the "Feynman Technique"**: Try to explain concepts in simple language. Where you struggle to simplify, you have weak understanding.

- **Write explanations**: Writing forces more complete explanations than silent reading.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Understanding feels obvious, so I don't need to explain"**
The illusion of comprehension is common—material feels clear when reading, but gaps emerge when you try to explain. Self-explanation catches these gaps.

**"Self-explanation is just summarizing"**
Effective self-explanation goes beyond summary to include inferences, reasoning, and connections. It's not just "what" but "why" and "how."

**"If I read carefully, self-explanation is redundant"**
Even careful reading can be passive. Self-explanation forces active processing that generates deeper understanding.

**"Self-explanation takes too much time"**
Self-explanation requires more time during initial studying but produces better learning, reducing the need for restudying. It's more efficient overall.

## Design Considerations

- **Provide scaffolds for novices**: Less skilled learners may need prompts or sentence starters to guide productive self-explanation.

- **Check explanation quality**: Simply telling someone to "explain" doesn't guarantee quality. Provide feedback on explanations when possible.

- **Balance explanation with practice**: Self-explanation is powerful for understanding, but learners also need practice applying what they've learned.

- **Make it efficient**: While self-explanation takes time, it can be integrated efficiently—explaining every step isn't necessary, but explaining key conceptual steps is valuable.
