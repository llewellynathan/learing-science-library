## What It Is

Question-driven learning organizes learning around compelling questions that learners want to answer. Instead of presenting information that might someday be useful, this approach starts with a question that creates a knowledge gap and motivates learners to fill it. "How did life begin?" "Why do bridges collapse?" "Can machines think?" "How do I build a successful business?"

The power of questions comes from how they create what psychologist George Loewenstein called an "information gap"—the uncomfortable awareness of not knowing something you want to know. This gap motivates inquiry, focuses attention, organizes learning, and creates structure for remembering. Information learned in service of answering a meaningful question is better retained and more readily transferred than information learned without purpose.

Questions also shape what gets noticed and remembered. When you're seeking an answer, you filter information through the lens of that question. This active filtering creates organized, goal-directed knowledge rather than disconnected facts.

## The Research

- **Loewenstein (1994)** proposed the information gap theory of curiosity, showing that questions create motivational states that drive information-seeking. Moderate uncertainty is most motivating—knowing enough to know you don't know.

- **Graesser & McMahen (1993)** found that students generated deeper questions when instruction was framed around problems to solve rather than content to learn, and that question-asking predicted learning outcomes.

- **Krajcik & Shin (2014)** demonstrated that project-based learning organized around driving questions produced significant gains in science content knowledge, motivation, and problem-solving skills compared to traditional instruction.

- **Willingham (2009)** argued that the brain is designed to solve problems, and that presenting information as answers to questions that haven't been asked makes learning difficult. Questions create the cognitive need that makes content meaningful.

- **Wong (1985)** showed that teaching students to generate questions about material improved their comprehension more than just having them read or summarize.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Open with questions, not content**: Begin modules with compelling questions that create curiosity. The content should feel like an answer to a question the learner wants answered.

- **Design for question generation**: Build in prompts for learners to generate their own questions. "What do you wonder about this topic?" Questions they generate are more motivating than questions you assign.

- **Create knowledge gaps**: Provide enough information to be intriguing but not enough to satisfy. This moderate uncertainty motivates continued engagement.

- **Connect content to questions**: Throughout learning, explicitly link content to driving questions. "This helps us answer our question by..."

- **Celebrate answered questions**: When questions get answered, mark the moment. The satisfaction of answered questions reinforces question-driven learning.

### For Educators

- **Start with questions**: Open lessons with questions that create genuine curiosity. Not review questions ("Who can tell me...") but intriguing questions that set up the learning.

- **Use essential questions**: Frame units around "essential questions"—questions big enough to sustain inquiry and deep enough to require real thinking.

- **Teach question generation**: Help students learn to ask good questions—questions that are investigable, meaningful, and lead to deeper understanding.

- **Value student questions**: When students ask questions, treat these as learning opportunities, not interruptions. Student questions reveal what they find compelling.

- **Connect to student interests**: Help students connect content to questions they already care about. Personal relevance transforms obligation into curiosity.

### For Self-Learners

- **Learn to answer questions**: Approach learning with specific questions you want answered. Before studying, articulate what you want to know.

- **Generate questions while reading**: As you read, generate questions. What do you want to know? What's confusing? What would you ask the author?

- **Pursue your curiosity**: When something sparks your interest, follow it. The most effective learning often happens when pursuing genuine questions.

- **Use questions to organize**: Organize your notes and study around questions. "What are the key questions in this field? What have I learned about each?"

- **Revisit unanswered questions**: Keep track of questions you can't yet answer. They're markers for future learning.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Cover the content, and questions will follow"**
Content without questions often produces neither understanding nor retention. Questions should precede and organize content, not just follow it.

**"Any question is a good question"**
Questions vary in quality. Shallow questions produce shallow learning; deep questions drive deep inquiry. Teaching question-asking is teaching thinking.

**"Questions slow down content coverage"**
While questions take time, they improve learning efficiency. Content "covered" without questions is often content forgotten. Engaged inquiry covers less but teaches more.

**"Students should answer questions, not ask them"**
Both are important. Teaching students to ask good questions may be more valuable than teaching them to answer teacher-generated questions.

## Design Considerations

- **Question quality matters**: Driving questions should be meaningful, engaging, and investigable. Trivial questions don't motivate deep inquiry.

- **Individual versus shared questions**: Personal questions are more motivating, but shared questions build community. Balance individual curiosity with collective inquiry.

- **Questions evolve**: Initial questions may be naive or poorly formed. Good question-driven learning allows questions to deepen and refine over time.

- **Unanswerable questions**: Some questions can't be fully answered with available time and resources. Ensure questions can be meaningfully addressed, even if not completely answered.

- **Questions connect to goals**: For formal learning, driving questions should connect to learning objectives. Personal curiosity and curriculum goals should align.
