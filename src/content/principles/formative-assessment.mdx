## What It Is

Formative assessment is the use of assessment during learning to provide feedback to learners and teachers and to adjust instruction accordingly. It contrasts with summative assessment, which evaluates learning at the end of a unit or course.

The key distinction isn't the format of assessment (quiz vs. test) but its purpose: formative assessment is for learning, summative assessment is of learning. The same assessment tool can be used formatively or summatively depending on how results are used.

Formative assessment works through several mechanisms: it provides feedback to learners about their understanding, reveals gaps to teachers who can then adjust instruction, and engages learners in retrieval practice that strengthens memory. When assessment is truly formative, both teaching and learning adapt based on assessment information.

## The Research

- **Black & Wiliam (1998)** reviewed over 250 studies on formative assessment and found substantial effects on learning, with effect sizes ranging from 0.4 to 0.7—among the largest of any educational intervention.

- **Kingston & Nash (2011)** meta-analyzed formative assessment studies and found an average effect size of 0.20, noting that effect size varied considerably based on implementation quality.

- **Wiliam (2011)** argued that effective formative assessment requires five key strategies: clarifying learning intentions, engineering discussions and tasks that elicit evidence, providing feedback that moves learners forward, activating students as resources for one another, and activating students as owners of their own learning.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Build in frequent check-ins**: Create regular, low-stakes assessment moments throughout learning experiences.

- **Provide actionable feedback**: Don't just indicate right/wrong—give information that helps learners improve.

- **Allow multiple attempts**: Formative assessment should support learning, not just measure it. Let learners try again after feedback.

- **Adapt based on assessment**: Use assessment data to personalize subsequent content and practice.

### For Educators

- **Ask questions that reveal thinking**: Use questions that expose how students are thinking, not just whether they know the answer.

- **Use wait time**: After asking a question, wait several seconds before calling on students. This increases participation and reveals more thinking.

- **Check all students**: Use techniques like whiteboard responses, polling, or exit tickets that show you every student's understanding, not just volunteers'.

- **Adjust instruction based on results**: Formative assessment is only formative if you use it to inform teaching.

### For Self-Learners

- **Test yourself frequently**: Regular self-quizzing reveals gaps in understanding while the material is fresh enough to address.

- **Analyze errors**: Don't just note wrong answers—figure out why you were wrong and what you misunderstood.

- **Adjust your studying**: Use self-assessment results to focus on areas of weakness.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Formative assessment means giving more quizzes"**
Frequent quizzes can be formative, but only if the results are used to provide feedback and guide learning. Quizzes given and forgotten aren't formative.

**"Formative assessment is just for teachers to monitor progress"**
Effective formative assessment involves students as active participants who understand learning goals and can assess their own progress.

**"Any assessment during instruction is formative"**
Assessment is only formative when it's used to adapt teaching and learning, not merely to generate grades.

## Design Considerations

- **Assess what matters**: Formative assessment should reveal understanding of important concepts and skills, not just recall of details.

- **Balance assessment and instruction**: Too much assessment can crowd out learning time. Find efficient ways to check understanding.

- **Support teacher/learner use**: Provide assessment results in formats that support action—what should be done next?

- **Create psychological safety**: Formative assessment should feel like an aid to learning, not a threat. Reduce stakes and emphasize growth.
