## What It Is

Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence, abilities, and talents can be developed through effort, good strategies, and input from others. This contrasts with a fixed mindset—the belief that abilities are innate and unchangeable. The concept, developed by Carol Dweck and colleagues, suggests that these beliefs about the nature of ability have profound effects on how people approach challenges, respond to setbacks, and ultimately achieve.

People with a growth mindset tend to:
- Embrace challenges as opportunities to grow
- Persist through obstacles rather than giving up
- See effort as the path to mastery
- Learn from criticism rather than feeling threatened by it
- Find inspiration in others' success rather than feeling threatened

People with a fixed mindset tend to:
- Avoid challenges that might reveal inadequacy
- Give up easily when facing obstacles
- See effort as a sign of low ability ("If I were smart, this would be easy")
- Ignore useful feedback
- Feel threatened by others' success

Importantly, mindsets are not all-or-nothing. People may have growth mindsets in some domains (art, sports) and fixed mindsets in others (math, social skills). Mindsets can also change—and interventions designed to shift mindsets have shown meaningful effects on motivation and performance.

## The Research

- **Dweck & Leggett (1988)** established the theoretical framework, showing that beliefs about the nature of intelligence affect the goals people pursue and how they respond to challenge.

- **Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck (2007)** followed 7th graders over two years and found that students who believed intelligence is malleable improved more in math than those with fixed beliefs. A brief intervention teaching growth mindset improved grades, particularly for students who had been declining.

- **Yeager & Dweck (2012)** reviewed evidence showing that mindset interventions can reduce stereotype threat, improve achievement in underperforming students, and increase persistence in challenging courses.

- **Yeager et al. (2019)** conducted a large-scale study of over 12,000 9th graders. A brief online growth mindset intervention improved grades in lower-achieving students and increased enrollment in advanced math courses. The effects were concentrated in schools where peer norms supported the message.

- **Sisk et al. (2018)** meta-analyzed mindset research and found modest but meaningful effects: mindset interventions had a small average effect on academic achievement (d = 0.10), but larger effects for academically at-risk students (d = 0.19). The relationship between mindset and achievement was also modest (r = 0.10).

The research shows that growth mindset effects are real but context-dependent. They're strongest when the environment supports the message and when students face challenges that could otherwise lead to disengagement.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Normalize struggle**: Frame difficulty as a normal part of learning, not a sign of inadequacy. Use messaging like "This is challenging—that means your brain is growing."

- **Praise process, not person**: Avoid "You're so smart!" feedback. Instead, recognize effort, strategy, and progress: "That approach worked well" or "You stuck with that despite the difficulty."

- **Reframe errors as learning opportunities**: When learners make mistakes, frame them positively: "Great! Now your brain knows what doesn't work—let's try another approach."

- **Show growth over time**: Visualize progress and improvement, not just current performance. Help learners see that their abilities have developed and will continue to develop.

- **Provide strategy feedback**: Don't just tell learners they're wrong—give them actionable strategies for improvement. Growth mindset without actionable strategies is just optimism.

### For Educators

- **Teach about the brain**: Help students understand that the brain is like a muscle—it grows stronger with use. Neuroplasticity research shows that learning physically changes the brain.

- **Model a growth mindset**: Share your own struggles and how you've improved through effort. Avoid statements like "I'm just not a math person"—these model fixed mindset.

- **Use "yet"**: When students say "I can't do this," add "yet." This simple reframe shifts from a fixed state to a growth trajectory.

- **Critique helpfully**: Provide critical feedback, but frame it as guidance for improvement, not judgment of inherent ability.

- **Create a culture of growth**: Classroom norms around mistakes, struggle, and effort shape whether individual mindset interventions take root.

### For Self-Learners

- **Notice your self-talk**: When you think "I'm not good at this," add "yet" and focus on what you can do to improve.

- **Reframe challenge**: When something feels hard, remind yourself that struggle is the feeling of your brain growing.

- **Focus on process**: Evaluate your learning based on effort and strategy use, not just outcomes. Did you try new approaches? Did you persist through difficulty?

- **Seek out challenges**: Deliberately choose learning opportunities that stretch your abilities rather than staying in your comfort zone.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Growth mindset means believing anyone can achieve anything with effort"**
Growth mindset is about the malleability of abilities, not limitlessness. It doesn't claim that effort alone produces any outcome—strategies, support, and resources also matter. The point is that abilities *can* develop, not that they're unlimited.

**"Praising effort is always good"**
Simply praising effort without improvement can feel hollow ("I know I tried hard, but I still failed"). Effective praise acknowledges effort as part of a productive strategy that leads to improvement, not as a consolation prize.

**"Growth mindset is just positive thinking"**
Growth mindset without action—without effective strategies, feedback, and practice—doesn't produce results. It's not about belief alone, but about how beliefs shape behaviors like persistence, strategy-seeking, and response to feedback.

**"You either have a fixed or growth mindset"**
Mindsets aren't all-or-nothing. People have different beliefs in different domains and situations. Someone might have a growth mindset about writing but a fixed mindset about math. Mindsets also fluctuate over time.

**"Growth mindset interventions are a silver bullet"**
Meta-analyses show modest average effects, and the research has faced criticism about replication and effect sizes. Growth mindset is one factor among many that influence motivation and achievement—not a cure-all.

## Design Considerations

- **Context matters enormously**: Growth mindset interventions work best when the environment supports the message. A growth mindset message in a context that punishes failure or rewards only natural ability will fall flat.

- **Actions must follow beliefs**: Shifting mindset without providing strategies, support, and opportunities for growth-producing struggle won't produce results. Mindset is a starting point, not an endpoint.

- **Avoid the "false growth mindset"**: Saying you have a growth mindset while praising innate ability, avoiding challenge, or treating failure as shameful undermines the message. Authenticity matters.

- **Target at-risk students strategically**: Research suggests growth mindset interventions have larger effects for students who are struggling or at risk of disengagement. They may have less impact on students who are already succeeding.

- **Integrate with other principles**: Growth mindset pairs well with desirable difficulties, deliberate practice, and feedback-rich environments. These create conditions where a growth mindset can translate into actual growth.
