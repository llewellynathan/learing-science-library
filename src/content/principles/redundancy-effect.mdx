## What It Is

The redundancy effect occurs when presenting the same information in multiple forms that don't add value beyond a single form. The classic example is presenting on-screen text while simultaneously reading that text aloud—the spoken narration is redundant with the written text, and processing both consumes cognitive resources without benefit.

The redundancy effect may seem to contradict the dual-coding principle, which says that combining verbal and visual information helps learning. The difference is that dual coding involves complementary information (words and pictures that contribute different information), while redundancy involves duplicative information (the same content in multiple forms).

Redundancy is harmful because learners must process both sources and reconcile them, even when one source would be sufficient. This processing consumes working memory resources without contributing to understanding.

## The Research

- **Chandler & Sweller (1991)** showed that diagram-only presentations outperformed diagram-plus-text presentations when the text simply described what the diagram already showed clearly.

- **Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller (1999)** demonstrated that experienced learners performed worse with redundant text added to diagrams, while the same text helped novices for whom the diagram alone was insufficient.

- **Mayer et al. (2001)** found that animation with narration produced better learning than animation with narration plus on-screen text. The redundant text hurt rather than helped.

- **Kalyuga & Sweller (2014)** reviewed redundancy research, confirming that the effect is robust but depends on learner expertise—what's redundant for experts may be helpful for novices.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Don't narrate on-screen text**: If text is displayed on screen, don't read it aloud verbatim. Either use narration alone, text alone, or have narration add information beyond the text.

- **Eliminate decorative text**: If a diagram clearly communicates information, don't add a text description that says the same thing.

- **Consider learner expertise**: Information that's redundant for advanced learners may be necessary for novices. One-size-fits-all may not work.

- **Audit for redundancy**: Review materials and ask: "Does this add information or just repeat what's already clear?"

### For Educators

- **Don't read slides aloud**: If slides contain text, either present the text visually while you elaborate verbally on different points, or remove the text and speak.

- **Remove redundant explanations**: If a diagram clearly shows something, don't also write it out in text unless the text adds information.

- **Consider what students already know**: Explanation that helps novices may be redundant and distracting for more advanced students.

### For Self-Learners

- **Skip redundant content**: If you understand something from one source, you don't need to process the same information in another form.

- **Create streamlined notes**: Don't copy redundant information. Capture what you need, not everything.

## Common Misconceptions

**"More explanation is always better"**
Additional explanation only helps when it adds new information or clarity. Redundant explanation wastes cognitive resources.

**"This contradicts dual coding"**
Dual coding involves complementary information—pictures and words that contribute different things. Redundancy involves duplicative information. Using narration and different visuals helps; using narration that just describes the visual doesn't.

**"Repeating important points aids retention"**
Spaced repetition (revisiting information over time) aids retention. Simultaneous redundant presentation of the same information in different forms doesn't have the same benefit.

**"If I remove information, learners will miss something"**
Removing genuinely redundant information doesn't deprive learners of anything—by definition, the information is available elsewhere. It frees cognitive resources for actual learning.

## Design Considerations

- **Distinguish complementary from redundant**: Ask whether each element contributes unique information or just repeats what's elsewhere.

- **Expertise matters greatly**: The same information may be essential for novices but redundant for experts. Consider adaptive designs.

- **Audio-visual redundancy is especially harmful**: The eyes and ears are separate channels, but processing redundant information across them still consumes cognitive resources.

- **Test with learners**: Designers may not recognize redundancy that novice learners struggle to reconcile.
