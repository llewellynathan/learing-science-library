## What It Is

Traditional views held that errors should be avoided in learning because they might be remembered instead of correct information. But research shows that under the right conditions, errors can actually enhance learning. When learners make an error and then receive corrective feedback, they often remember the correct information better than if they had never erred at all.

This counterintuitive finding occurs because errors create "prediction error"—a mismatch between what we expected and what happened. This mismatch signals the brain to update its understanding, leading to stronger encoding of the correct information. Additionally, attempting to retrieve an answer (even unsuccessfully) activates related knowledge structures that can support subsequent learning.

The key condition is that errors must be followed by corrective feedback. Errors left uncorrected can indeed entrench misconceptions. But errors followed by clear feedback create powerful learning moments.

## The Research

- **Kornell, Hays, & Bjork (2009)** showed that unsuccessful retrieval attempts enhanced learning from subsequent feedback compared to simply studying the correct answer. Making errors (and then being corrected) helped memory.

- **Metcalfe (2017)** reviewed error research and concluded that errors followed by feedback consistently produce better learning than errorless learning, particularly for high-confidence errors.

- **Butterfield & Metcalfe (2001)** found that high-confidence errors were especially well-corrected after feedback—the surprising contradiction between confidence and reality created strong learning.

- **Potts, Shanks, & Sherlock (2019)** demonstrated that pretesting (attempting to answer questions before studying) enhanced subsequent learning even when pretest answers were wrong, supporting the "generation effect" for errors.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Allow errors to occur**: Don't prevent all errors with hints and scaffolds. Some productive struggle is valuable.

- **Provide immediate corrective feedback**: When errors occur, provide clear feedback that shows the correct answer and explains why.

- **Use pretesting**: Ask questions about material before learners have studied it. Even unsuccessful attempts enhance subsequent learning.

- **Highlight corrections clearly**: Make the contrast between the error and the correct answer salient.

### For Educators

- **Create safe spaces for errors**: Establish classroom norms where errors are seen as learning opportunities, not failures to be ashamed of.

- **Use prediction before instruction**: Ask students to predict answers before teaching. Wrong predictions make the correct information more memorable.

- **Address errors explicitly**: Don't just move on from wrong answers—discuss why the error might have occurred and why the correct answer is correct.

- **Model making and correcting errors**: Show that even experts make errors and that the key is learning from them.

### For Self-Learners

- **Don't avoid mistakes**: Attempting challenging material where you might fail produces better learning than staying in your comfort zone.

- **Review errors carefully**: When you get something wrong, don't just note the right answer—understand why you were wrong.

- **Test yourself before you're ready**: Attempting retrieval before you've fully learned material (pretesting) enhances subsequent studying.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Errors should be avoided to prevent learning wrong information"**
This "errorless learning" view has been challenged. With corrective feedback, errors often enhance learning compared to never having erred.

**"Making errors means you're not learning"**
Errors during practice are often signs that you're working at the edge of your competence—the productive zone where learning happens.

**"All errors are equally beneficial"**
Errors that are left uncorrected or that arise from random guessing are not beneficial. Errors that arise from genuine attempts, followed by feedback, are what produce benefits.

**"Confident errors are especially bad"**
Counterintuitively, high-confidence errors show the largest correction effects. The surprise of being confidently wrong creates strong learning.

## Design Considerations

- **Always pair errors with feedback**: The benefit of errors comes from the correction, not from being wrong per se.

- **Create psychological safety**: Learners need to feel safe making errors. High-stakes, punitive environments discourage the productive risk-taking that leads to learning.

- **Distinguish productive and unproductive errors**: Errors from genuine engagement are productive; errors from carelessness or random guessing are not.

- **Time feedback appropriately**: Feedback on errors is generally most effective when provided promptly, before the context is forgotten.
