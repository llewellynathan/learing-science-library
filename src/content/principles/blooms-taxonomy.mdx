## What It Is

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing educational goals and cognitive tasks by their complexity and type. The original taxonomy (1956) and its revision (2001) organize cognitive processes into hierarchical levels, from basic recall of facts to sophisticated creation of new ideas.

The revised taxonomy includes six levels (from simpler to more complex):
1. **Remember**: Recall facts, terms, and basic concepts
2. **Understand**: Explain ideas, interpret meaning, summarize
3. **Apply**: Use information in new situations, solve problems
4. **Analyze**: Draw connections, identify causes, make inferences
5. **Evaluate**: Justify decisions, critique, assess value
6. **Create**: Produce new work, design, construct

The taxonomy serves as a tool for designing learning experiences that address multiple cognitive levels, for creating assessments that measure different types of learning, and for helping learners understand what different tasks ask of them. It's not a strict hierarchy where lower levels must precede higher ones, but a framework for ensuring comprehensive cognitive engagement.

## The Research

- **Bloom et al. (1956)** developed the original taxonomy to help educators create more precise learning objectives and assessments. It became one of the most widely used frameworks in education.

- **Anderson & Krathwohl (2001)** revised the taxonomy, changing from nouns to verbs (knowledge → remember) and switching the order of the top two levels (creating is now above evaluating). They also added a knowledge dimension (factual, conceptual, procedural, metacognitive).

- **Crowe et al. (2008)** developed Blooming Biology Tool (BBT) to assess biology assessments against Bloom's levels, finding that many assessments overemphasize lower levels while neglecting higher-order thinking.

- **Hattie (2009)** meta-analyzed learning strategies and found that the most effective strategies often target higher Bloom's levels—requiring students to evaluate and create rather than just remember.

- **Biggs & Tang (2011)** developed "constructive alignment," arguing that learning objectives (often phrased using Bloom's verbs), teaching activities, and assessments should all align at consistent cognitive levels.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Design tasks at multiple levels**: Don't only assess recall. Include application, analysis, and creation tasks that require deeper cognitive engagement.

- **Use Bloom's verbs for objectives**: Phrase learning objectives with specific verbs: "The learner will be able to analyze..." rather than vague goals like "understand."

- **Scaffold toward higher levels**: Begin with remember/understand tasks, then progress to apply/analyze/evaluate/create as learners develop competence.

- **Match assessment to objectives**: If you want learners to be able to analyze, assess analysis—not just recall. The assessment should match the stated cognitive level.

- **Create creation opportunities**: Include tasks where learners produce new work—design projects, create explanations, solve novel problems—not just consume content.

### For Educators

- **Audit your assessments**: Classify your test questions by Bloom's level. Many assessments skew heavily toward lower levels; aim for balance across levels appropriate to your goals.

- **Ask higher-order questions**: Move beyond "What is X?" to "How would X apply to Y?" or "What would happen if Z?" or "Create a solution to W."

- **Teach the taxonomy to students**: Help students understand what different cognitive tasks require. "This question asks you to evaluate, which means..."

- **Design tiered assignments**: Offer tasks at different levels, or design assignments that require movement through multiple levels (gather information, analyze it, create a product).

- **Recognize level-jumping**: Sometimes creative tasks precede comprehensive knowledge. The taxonomy isn't strictly sequential—use it flexibly.

### For Self-Learners

- **Self-assess your learning level**: Can you only remember what you learned, or can you apply, analyze, evaluate, and create? Honest assessment reveals gaps.

- **Practice at higher levels**: Don't stop when you can recall. Push yourself to apply concepts, analyze arguments, evaluate alternatives, and create new things.

- **Use Bloom's verbs as prompts**: Challenge yourself with questions at each level: "Can I define it? Explain it? Apply it? Analyze it? Evaluate it? Create something new with it?"

- **Recognize when you're stuck at lower levels**: If you can define concepts but can't apply them, you've identified a specific growth area.

- **Create to learn**: Teaching, writing, building, and creating push you to higher cognitive levels than passive consumption.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Lower levels are bad; higher levels are good"**
All levels serve important purposes. Experts need factual knowledge (remember) and comprehension (understand) as foundations. Higher levels aren't inherently better—they're different.

**"You must master each level before proceeding to the next"**
Learning doesn't strictly progress level by level. You might create before you fully understand, and creation deepens understanding. The hierarchy is a framework, not a required sequence.

**"Bloom's Taxonomy is the only or best framework"**
Other frameworks exist (Webb's Depth of Knowledge, Marzano's taxonomy, etc.). Bloom's is widely used and useful, but it's one tool among several for thinking about cognitive complexity.

**"Every lesson needs all six levels"**
Not every lesson needs to reach create or evaluate. The appropriate level depends on goals, student readiness, and context. The taxonomy helps ensure you're intentional about which levels you're targeting.

## Design Considerations

- **Verbs are not mechanical**: Using Bloom's verbs in objectives doesn't guarantee learning at that level. The actual cognitive demand depends on the task, not just the verb used to describe it.

- **Level depends on novelty**: A task that requires "application" for a novice might be mere "recall" for an expert who has applied that knowledge many times. Level is relative to the learner.

- **Knowledge types matter**: The revised taxonomy adds a knowledge dimension (factual, conceptual, procedural, metacognitive). Consider both the cognitive process and the knowledge type.

- **Higher levels take more time**: Tasks at higher levels typically require more time and support. Plan accordingly—covering less content at higher levels often produces better outcomes than covering more at lower levels.

- **Cultural and disciplinary variation**: What counts as "create" or "evaluate" varies across disciplines and cultures. Apply the framework thoughtfully to your context.
