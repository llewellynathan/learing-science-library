## What It Is

Interleaving is a learning strategy where you mix different topics, skills, or problem types during practice, rather than practicing one type extensively before moving to the next. Instead of practicing all addition problems, then all subtraction problems (blocked practice: AAAA BBBB CCCC), you would mix them together (interleaved practice: ABC BCA CAB).

The principle works because interleaving forces learners to continuously retrieve the appropriate strategy or knowledge from memory and discriminate between similar concepts. When you see the same type of problem repeatedly, you know what strategy to use without really having to identify the problem type. When problems are mixed, you must first recognize *what kind* of problem it is, then retrieve the relevant approach—which is exactly what you need to do in real-world situations.

Interleaving feels harder than blocked practice, and performance during practice is typically worse. But this difficulty is desirable: the struggle to discriminate and retrieve produces deeper, more flexible learning that transfers better to new situations.

## The Research

- **Rohrer & Taylor (2007)** taught college students to calculate the volumes of four different geometric shapes. Students who practiced with interleaved problems scored 43% on a test one week later, while students who used blocked practice scored only 20%—despite blocked practice producing better performance *during* practice.

- **Kornell & Bjork (2008)** had participants learn the painting styles of 12 different artists. Interleaved study produced 60% accuracy on new paintings compared to 35% for blocked study. Remarkably, 78% of participants believed that blocked practice was more effective, even though their performance told the opposite story.

- **Taylor & Rohrer (2010)** showed fourth-graders how to calculate the faces, edges, corners, and angles of prisms. Interleaved practice produced 77% accuracy on a one-day delayed test versus 38% for blocked practice.

- **Birnbaum et al. (2013)** found that interleaving helped people learn to identify different species of butterflies and birds—interleaved learners were better at classifying new examples they'd never seen before.

The benefits of interleaving appear across mathematics, motor skills, category learning, and even medical diagnosis training.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Mix problem types in practice sets**: Instead of grouping all similar problems together, intersperse different types throughout the practice session.

- **Interleave across lessons**: When reviewing previous material, mix it with new material rather than reviewing in chronological blocks.

- **Design for discrimination**: Create practice that requires learners to identify which concept or strategy applies, not just execute it.

- **Combine with spacing**: Interleaving naturally creates some spacing between same-type problems, compounding the benefits.

### For Educators

- **Mixed homework assignments**: Include problems from current and previous topics on each assignment, rather than only assigning problems related to the day's lesson.

- **Spiral review**: During class warm-ups, include one or two problems from each of several previous topics rather than focusing review on one area.

- **Teach discrimination explicitly**: Help students recognize the features that distinguish different problem types before asking them to practice in interleaved fashion.

- **Prepare students for the difficulty**: Interleaved practice feels harder, so students may resist it. Explain why you're using this approach and show evidence of its effectiveness.

### For Self-Learners

- **Mix up your practice**: If you're learning multiple things (vocabulary words from different categories, math procedures, music pieces), practice them in rotation rather than mastering one before moving to the next.

- **Use shuffled flashcards**: Don't sort flashcard decks by topic—shuffle them so you encounter different types in random order.

- **Vary your practice contexts**: Study in different locations, at different times, using different formats. This variability shares some mechanisms with interleaving.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Interleaving makes practice feel harder, so it must be hurting learning"**
This is the core paradox of interleaving. Performance during interleaved practice is typically worse than during blocked practice—you make more errors, work more slowly, and feel less confident. But this struggle is productive: it forces the discrimination and retrieval processes that strengthen learning. Judge learning by delayed tests, not by performance during practice.

**"Interleaving works for everything"**
Interleaving is most beneficial when learners need to distinguish between similar concepts, strategies, or categories. For initial instruction on completely new material—before learners have any foundation—some blocked practice may be appropriate to establish basic competence. But interleaving should be introduced relatively early, not reserved for "mastery."

**"I should randomly mix everything together"**
Effective interleaving doesn't mean random chaos. The mixed items should be related enough that distinguishing between them is meaningful. Interleaving verb conjugations with calculus problems isn't helpful because there's no discrimination learning happening—they're obviously different. Interleaving similar verb conjugations, or related calculus techniques, is where the benefits emerge.

**"Interleaving is the opposite of focused practice"**
Interleaving doesn't mean you never focus on one skill. It means you don't do *only* blocked practice. A blend often works well: brief focused practice to establish basics, then interleaved practice to develop discrimination and transfer.

## Design Considerations

- **Sequence strategically**: Don't interleave before learners have any knowledge of the topics. Some initial instruction on each type is necessary before mixing makes sense.

- **Manage cognitive load**: Interleaving increases difficulty. If learners are already struggling with basic concepts, adding interleaving may overwhelm them. Gauge readiness carefully.

- **Consider similarity**: Interleave items that are similar enough to benefit from discrimination training. Mixing highly dissimilar items doesn't provide much benefit.

- **Explain the approach**: Because interleaving feels worse during practice, learners may avoid it or question why you're using it. Transparent explanation of the research can help build buy-in.

- **Use adaptive interleaving**: More advanced learners can handle more interleaving. Consider systems that adjust the degree of mixing based on performance.
