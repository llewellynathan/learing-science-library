## What It Is

Metacognition is "thinking about thinking"—the awareness and understanding of one's own cognitive processes. It involves two components: metacognitive knowledge (what you know about your own learning and thinking) and metacognitive regulation (how you monitor and control your learning processes).

Metacognitive knowledge includes knowing your strengths and weaknesses, understanding which strategies work for you, and recognizing when you do and don't understand something. Metacognitive regulation includes planning how to approach a learning task, monitoring comprehension during learning, and evaluating how well you've learned after studying.

Metacognition matters because learners who accurately understand their own learning are better equipped to make good decisions about what to study, how to study, and when to move on. Poor metacognition leads to illusions of competence—thinking you know something when you don't—which results in inadequate preparation and poor performance.

## The Research

- **Flavell (1979)** introduced the concept of metacognition and began systematic study of children's metacognitive development.

- **Brown (1987)** distinguished metacognitive knowledge from metacognitive regulation and showed that both could be taught and both improved learning.

- **Dunlosky & Metcalfe (2009)** reviewed decades of research on judgments of learning, showing that people are often overconfident about their knowledge—they think they know more than they do.

- **Dignath & Büttner (2008)** meta-analyzed metacognitive training studies and found significant effects on learning outcomes (d = 0.54), confirming that metacognition can be taught and that teaching it improves performance.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Prompt self-assessment**: Ask learners to predict their performance before testing, then compare predictions to results. This calibrates metacognitive accuracy.

- **Include confidence ratings**: Have learners rate their confidence alongside answers. Reviewing confidence vs. accuracy builds metacognitive awareness.

- **Provide study strategy guidance**: Teach learners which strategies work best for different types of material.

- **Delay retrieval**: Immediate testing can inflate confidence. Slightly delayed testing gives more accurate metacognitive feedback.

### For Educators

- **Teach about learning**: Explicitly discuss how learning works, what strategies are effective, and why certain approaches help.

- **Model metacognition**: Think aloud about your own learning processes—how you decide what to study, how you know when you understand something.

- **Have students predict and evaluate**: Before tests, have students predict their performance. Afterward, compare predictions to results and discuss calibration.

- **Teach strategy selection**: Help students learn when different strategies are appropriate—when to take notes, when to practice retrieval, when to seek help.

### For Self-Learners

- **Test yourself before high-stakes performance**: Practice tests reveal actual knowledge more accurately than the feeling of familiarity.

- **Trust retrieval over recognition**: If you can produce information without prompts, you likely know it. If you can only recognize it, you may not.

- **Track your predictions**: Before tests, write down how well you expect to do. Afterward, compare. Over time, improve calibration.

- **Know your strategies**: Understand which study methods work best for you and why.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Feeling like I know it means I know it"**
Feeling of knowing is often inaccurate. Material that feels familiar may not be retrievable. Testing yourself provides more accurate metacognitive information than subjective feelings.

**"Some people naturally have good metacognition"**
While there are individual differences, metacognition can be taught and improved through practice and explicit instruction.

**"Metacognition is just self-awareness"**
Metacognition includes awareness but also regulation—planning, monitoring, and adjusting learning strategies. Both components are important.

**"Time spent on metacognition is time away from learning"**
Effective metacognition actually improves learning efficiency by directing effort to where it's needed and preventing wasted time on already-learned material.

## Design Considerations

- **Build in calibration opportunities**: Regular prediction-performance comparisons help learners develop accurate metacognitive awareness.

- **Provide feedback on metacognition**: Don't just give feedback on performance—help learners see how well they predicted their performance.

- **Make strategies explicit**: Don't assume learners know which strategies work. Teach and prompt effective approaches.

- **Support planning and monitoring**: Build in moments for learners to plan their approach and check their understanding before moving on.
