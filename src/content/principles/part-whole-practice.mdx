## What It Is

Part-whole practice involves breaking a complex skill into component parts, practicing those parts separately, and then combining them back into the complete performance. A pianist learning a difficult piece might practice the right hand alone, then the left hand, then combine them. A basketball player might practice dribbling, passing, and shooting separately before integrating them into full-game scenarios.

The logic is straightforward: complex skills can overwhelm learners when practiced as a whole. Breaking them into manageable parts allows learners to develop competence with each component before facing the challenge of coordination.

However, part-whole practice isn't always optimal. The effectiveness depends on how interdependent the parts are. When parts are relatively independent, practicing them separately works well. When parts are highly interdependent (each part affects the others), too much isolated practice can make integration difficult.

## The Research

- **Naylor & Briggs (1963)** proposed that the optimal practice method depends on task "organization" (how interdependent the parts are) and "complexity" (how difficult each part is). High complexity favors part practice; high organization favors whole practice.

- **Wightman & Lintern (1985)** showed that for flight training tasks, part-task training was effective when parts could be meaningfully isolated, but less effective when the task required tight coordination of components.

- **Goode & Magill (1986)** found that the benefit of part practice depended on how well the practiced parts transferred to the whole task. Some ways of segmenting produced better transfer than others.

- **Schmidt & Wrisberg (2008)** summarized the research, concluding that part practice is most appropriate when task complexity is high but organization is low—that is, when parts are difficult but relatively independent.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Analyze task structure**: Before designing part practice, analyze how interdependent the skill components are. This determines whether part practice will be effective.

- **Use progressive part practice**: Start with one part, add a second part, practice those two together, then add a third, and so on. This maintains integration while still breaking down complexity.

- **Include integration practice**: After part practice, always include practice of the complete integrated skill. Parts must eventually be combined.

- **Consider fractionation vs. segmentation**: Parts can be divided by simultaneous elements (fractionation—like practicing one hand at a time) or sequential elements (segmentation—practicing first half, then second half). Each has different strengths.

### For Educators

- **Break down complex skills thoughtfully**: Not every complex skill should be broken into parts. Consider whether the parts can be meaningfully practiced in isolation.

- **Don't stay in part practice too long**: Extended isolated practice can make integration harder. Move to whole practice as soon as learners can manage it.

- **Use part practice for initial learning, whole for refinement**: Part practice helps establish basic competence; whole practice develops coordination and timing.

### For Self-Learners

- **Identify the hard parts**: Use part practice strategically on the components that are giving you trouble, rather than uniformly breaking everything down.

- **Practice integration regularly**: Don't just practice parts—regularly attempt the whole skill to maintain the connections between parts.

- **Adjust based on progress**: If you're struggling with integration, you may have practiced parts in isolation too long. Practice them together earlier.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Always break complex skills into parts"**
Part practice isn't always best. Highly organized tasks (where parts are interdependent) may be better learned as wholes, even if that's initially harder.

**"Master each part before moving on"**
Waiting for perfect mastery of each part before integration can make the integration itself harder. Parts should be practiced to competence, not perfection, before combining.

**"The way you divide parts doesn't matter"**
How you segment the skill matters enormously. Poor segmentation can create artificial boundaries that make integration difficult.

## Design Considerations

- **Match segmentation to skill structure**: Identify natural breakpoints in the skill rather than arbitrary divisions.

- **Maintain temporal relationships**: If timing between parts matters, preserve some of those relationships even in part practice.

- **Use part practice selectively**: Reserve part practice for genuinely complex, decomposable skills. Simple skills may be better practiced whole from the start.
