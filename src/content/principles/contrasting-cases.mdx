## What It Is

Contrasting cases is a learning technique where examples are juxtaposed specifically to highlight their differences. Unlike typical comparison which often focuses on similarities, contrasting cases draws attention to the ways things differ—particularly differences that are meaningful but not obvious at first glance.

When you place two similar-looking things side by side and ask "what's different?", learners begin to notice features they would overlook if viewing each example separately. A wine taster comparing two similar wines notices subtleties invisible when tasting one wine alone. A student comparing two similar physics problems notices when different equations apply. This noticing of critical differences is fundamental to expertise.

The power of contrasting cases comes from preparing learners to notice and learn. Before explicit instruction, contrasting cases creates "a time for telling"—learners have noticed a puzzle or distinction that instruction can then explain. This preparation dramatically improves how much learners gain from subsequent teaching.

## The Research

- **Schwartz & Bransford (1998)** conducted seminal research showing that analyzing contrasting cases before instruction produced deeper learning than instruction alone. Students who analyzed cases were better prepared to learn from subsequent lectures.

- **Gentner & Markman (1994)** demonstrated that comparison processes align structural features of examples, allowing differences to become apparent. Comparison creates the "common ground" against which differences stand out.

- **Richland et al. (2007)** found that presenting contrasting cases with explicit comparison prompts improved learning more than presenting the same cases without comparison prompts. The comparison activity, not just exposure, drives the benefit.

- **Rittle-Johnson & Star (2007)** showed that comparing contrasting solution methods in mathematics improved both procedural flexibility and conceptual understanding compared to studying methods separately.

- **Alfieri et al. (2013)** meta-analyzed comparison-based learning and found significant positive effects, particularly when comparison was prompted rather than left implicit.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Create contrasting case sets**: For key concepts, develop pairs or sets of examples that are similar on the surface but differ on critical dimensions.

- **Design comparison interfaces**: Present contrasting cases side by side with features aligned to make comparison easy. Highlight or label key points of comparison.

- **Prompt active comparison**: Don't just show cases—ask learners to identify differences, explain distinctions, or predict which approach applies in what circumstances.

- **Use before instruction**: Present contrasting cases as preparation for learning, not just as application after instruction. The noticing that occurs prepares learners to understand explanations.

- **Include non-obvious contrasts**: The most valuable contrasting cases involve distinctions that aren't immediately apparent. These are where real expertise lies.

### For Educators

- **Show "this vs. that"**: Explicitly juxtapose similar but different examples. "This problem uses method A; this similar-looking problem uses method B. What's the difference?"

- **Have students generate distinctions**: After showing contrasting cases, ask students to articulate the key differences before you explain them.

- **Use for common confusions**: When students commonly confuse two concepts or procedures, contrasting cases can help them develop the discrimination they lack.

- **Compare student work**: Showing two student solutions (correct and incorrect, or two different correct approaches) creates powerful contrasting cases for the class.

- **Prepare before telling**: Use contrasting cases to set up a puzzle before explaining the concept. Students who notice the puzzle are primed to understand the explanation.

### For Self-Learners

- **Seek out pairs**: When learning a new concept, look for similar concepts to compare it to. What does this new thing differ from? What might be confused with it?

- **Compare examples explicitly**: When reviewing examples, don't just study each one—actively compare them. What's similar? What's different? Why?

- **Study your mistakes**: When you make an error, compare your approach to the correct approach. Juxtapose what you did with what you should have done.

- **Create comparison tables**: For domains with multiple similar items (species, diseases, concepts), create tables that align features and make differences visible.

- **Ask "what if" questions**: Change one feature of an example and ask what changes. This creates a contrast that reveals which features matter.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Comparing is just noticing similarities"**
While comparison involves noticing both similarities and differences, contrasting cases specifically leverages the differences. The goal is to develop discrimination—seeing distinctions, not just commonalities.

**"Students should master one thing before comparing"**
Research shows that comparison during early learning is valuable, not just after mastery. Contrasting cases help learners notice what matters before they've fully understood it.

**"Any examples can be compared"**
The examples chosen for comparison matter. Effective contrasting cases share enough similarity that comparison is meaningful, but differ on educationally important dimensions.

**"Noticing differences happens automatically"**
Critical differences are often invisible without explicit comparison. Expertise involves seeing distinctions that novices miss—and those distinctions need to be actively developed, not passively absorbed.

## Design Considerations

- **Selection of cases**: The cases chosen determine what can be learned. Cases should differ on the dimension you want learners to notice while being similar enough that comparison is natural.

- **Alignment of features**: When presenting contrasting cases, align corresponding features to make comparison easy. Misaligned presentations make comparison difficult and reduce learning.

- **Explicit prompts matter**: Simply presenting cases side by side isn't enough. Prompts that direct attention to key differences improve outcomes compared to unprompted comparison.

- **Difficulty calibration**: If cases are too similar, differences may be invisible; if too different, comparison may be pointless. Calibrate similarity to learner level and learning goals.

- **Time for comparison**: Contrasting cases analysis takes time. Rushing comparison reduces the benefit. Allow sufficient time for learners to engage with the comparison.
