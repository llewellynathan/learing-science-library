## What It Is

Concrete examples are specific, tangible instances that illustrate abstract concepts. Instead of only defining "supply and demand" in abstract terms, you might use the concrete example of concert tickets: when a popular artist announces a tour (high demand, limited supply), prices go up; when tickets don't sell (low demand), prices drop.

The power of concrete examples lies in their ability to ground abstract ideas in something learners can visualize, relate to, and remember. Abstract concepts are, by definition, removed from direct experience. Concrete examples bridge this gap by connecting abstractions to the sensory, experiential knowledge that humans naturally learn from.

This doesn't mean concrete examples replace abstract understanding—the goal is to use concrete examples as a pathway to abstraction. The best learning often involves moving back and forth between concrete instances and abstract principles, using each to illuminate the other.

## The Research

- **Rawson & Kintsch (2005)** showed that concrete sentences were remembered better than abstract sentences, even when controlling for other factors.

- **Sadoski, Goetz, & Fritz (1993)** found that text comprehension and recall improved significantly when concrete language and examples were used compared to abstract language alone.

- **Goldstone & Son (2005)** demonstrated that starting with concrete examples and gradually moving to abstract representations was effective for learning complex concepts—a process called "concreteness fading."

- **Fyfe et al. (2014)** showed that the optimal sequence for learning often involves beginning with concrete manipulatives, then transitioning to abstract representations, rather than starting abstract.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Lead with examples**: Before or alongside abstract definitions, provide concrete examples that illustrate the concept in action.

- **Use multiple examples**: A single example might be mistaken as the concept itself. Multiple varied examples help learners extract the underlying principle.

- **Choose relatable examples**: Examples work best when learners have relevant background knowledge. Choose examples from contexts your audience knows.

- **Implement concreteness fading**: Start with concrete representations, then gradually move toward abstract formulations as learners develop understanding.

### For Educators

- **Ask students for examples**: After teaching a concept, have students generate their own examples. This reveals understanding and deepens learning.

- **Use analogies and comparisons**: Analogies are essentially examples that leverage prior knowledge: "The cell membrane is like a security guard at a building entrance..."

- **Ground abstractions immediately**: Don't wait until the end to provide examples. Introduce concrete instances as soon as you introduce abstract concepts.

### For Self-Learners

- **Seek examples actively**: When reading abstract material, actively look for or create concrete examples. If the text doesn't provide them, generate your own.

- **Test your examples**: Can you explain why your example fits the concept? If not, you may have a superficial understanding.

- **Vary your examples**: Generate examples from different domains to ensure you've understood the abstract principle, not just one instantiation.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Concrete examples are only for beginners"**
While novices particularly benefit from concrete examples, even experts use them to communicate ideas, test understanding, and think through problems.

**"One good example is enough"**
Single examples can lead to overly narrow understanding. Multiple varied examples help learners identify what's essential to the concept versus what's incidental to a particular instance.

**"Concrete examples make learning too easy"**
Well-chosen examples don't make learning easy—they make it possible. The goal is appropriate difficulty, not maximum difficulty.

## Design Considerations

- **Balance concreteness and abstraction**: Staying too concrete can hinder transfer. Use concrete examples to build understanding, but help learners extract abstract principles.

- **Choose examples strategically**: Examples should highlight the essential features of the concept. Poorly chosen examples can mislead learners about what matters.

- **Consider learner background**: Examples are only concrete to learners who have relevant experience. A baseball analogy isn't concrete to someone who's never seen baseball.
