## What It Is

Interest is the psychological state of being engaged with and drawn to particular content, activities, or objects. Curiosity is the desire to acquire new knowledge, often triggered by gaps between what we know and what we want to know. Both are powerful drivers of learning because they direct attention, enhance engagement, and motivate deeper processing.

Researchers distinguish between individual interest (stable, long-term attraction to certain topics) and situational interest (temporary interest triggered by environmental features). Someone might have individual interest in history (they've always loved it) and experience situational interest in a compelling story about a historical event (even if history isn't usually their thing).

Curiosity operates through what Loewenstein called "information gaps"—when we become aware that we're missing information, we experience a drive to close that gap. This is why cliffhangers work: they create gaps that motivate continued engagement.

Both interest and curiosity can be leveraged in learning design, but they work somewhat differently. Interest involves sustained engagement with content; curiosity involves the drive to resolve uncertainty.

## The Research

- **Hidi & Renninger (2006)** developed a four-phase model of interest development: triggered situational interest → maintained situational interest → emerging individual interest → well-developed individual interest. Instructional interventions can support progression through these phases.

- **Loewenstein (1994)** proposed the information-gap theory of curiosity, suggesting that curiosity arises when we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know—and that moderate gaps produce the most curiosity.

- **Kang et al. (2009)** used fMRI to show that curiosity activates reward-related brain regions, and that people remember answers better when they were more curious about the questions.

- **Gruber, Gelman, & Ranganath (2014)** found that when people were curious about a topic, they remembered not just the target information but also incidental information presented alongside it—curiosity enhances memory broadly.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Create knowledge gaps**: Before presenting information, make learners aware of what they don't know. Questions, puzzles, and mysteries trigger curiosity.

- **Use seductive details carefully**: Interesting tangents can enhance engagement but may also distract from core content. Ensure interesting elements are relevant to learning goals.

- **Build on existing interests**: Connect content to topics learners already care about when possible.

- **Maintain optimal uncertainty**: Too much uncertainty overwhelms; too little bores. Calibrate complexity to create productive curiosity.

### For Educators

- **Start with questions**: Begin lessons with intriguing questions rather than answers. Let curiosity build before providing resolution.

- **Connect to student interests**: Find ways to relate required content to topics students already care about.

- **Model curiosity**: Demonstrate your own curiosity and interest in the subject matter. Enthusiasm is contagious.

- **Allow exploration**: Build in time for students to pursue questions that genuinely interest them, even if tangential.

### For Self-Learners

- **Follow your curiosity**: When something sparks your interest, pursue it. Curiosity-driven learning is more engaging and memorable.

- **Generate questions**: Before studying, write down questions you're curious about. This primes curiosity-driven engagement.

- **Notice what interests you**: Pay attention to when you feel genuinely engaged versus when you're just going through the motions.

## Common Misconceptions

**"You either find something interesting or you don't"**
Situational interest can be triggered even for topics someone doesn't have individual interest in. Good instruction can create interest through relevance, challenge, and engagement.

**"Interesting content always leads to better learning"**
"Seductive details"—interesting but irrelevant content—can actually hurt learning by distracting from core material. Interest should support, not distract from, learning goals.

**"Curiosity is purely positive"**
Excessive curiosity can lead to distraction, information overload, or going down rabbit holes. Productive curiosity needs some structure and goal-direction.

**"You can't teach interest"**
While you can't force genuine interest, instructional choices strongly influence whether situational interest is triggered and whether it develops into more lasting individual interest.

## Design Considerations

- **Balance novelty and relevance**: Curiosity is triggered by the right amount of novelty—too familiar is boring, too unfamiliar is confusing.

- **Create information gaps strategically**: Pose questions or problems before providing answers. Make learners want to know before telling them.

- **Connect to personal relevance**: Help learners see why content matters to their lives, goals, or interests.

- **Sustain interest over time**: Triggering initial interest is easier than maintaining it. Plan for how engagement will be sustained across longer learning experiences.
