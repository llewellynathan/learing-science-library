## What It Is

Social norms are unwritten rules about what is typical behavior (descriptive norms: "what people do") and what is approved behavior (injunctive norms: "what people should do") in a particular context. These norms powerfully shape learning behaviors—how much effort students invest, how they respond to difficulty, whether they seek help, and what they consider acceptable learning practices.

When learners believe that effort is normal, asking questions is valued, and struggle is expected, they behave accordingly. When they believe that learning should be effortless, asking questions shows weakness, and smart people don't struggle, they behave accordingly too. Norms create self-fulfilling prophecies: beliefs about what others do shapes what you do, which shapes what others actually observe.

Importantly, perceived norms often diverge from actual norms. Students may believe everyone else understands the material while struggling alone, unaware that most of their peers are equally confused. This pluralistic ignorance can suppress help-seeking and create harmful learning cultures.

## The Research

- **Cialdini et al. (2006)** established that descriptive norms (what others do) and injunctive norms (what others approve of) both influence behavior, and their effects can combine or conflict. Understanding both norm types is necessary to shape behavior effectively.

- **Prentice & Miller (1993)** documented pluralistic ignorance in campus alcohol culture, finding students privately disapproved of excessive drinking but believed others approved. Correcting this norm misperception reduced drinking—a pattern that applies to academic behaviors too.

- **Yeager et al. (2018)** found that norms about whether "challenge is normal and expected" versus "struggling means you don't belong" significantly affected student persistence and achievement in STEM courses.

- **Schultz et al. (2007)** demonstrated that information about neighbor energy use (a descriptive norm) was more effective at changing behavior than messages about environmental benefits. Learning what others actually do is powerfully motivating.

- **Bursztyn & Jensen (2015)** showed that students' willingness to sign up for SAT prep was influenced by whether their choice would be visible to peers, demonstrating how perceived peer norms shape educational choices.

## How to Apply It

### For Learning Designers & App Developers

- **Make positive norms visible**: Show learners that others engage, persist, and ask questions. Leaderboards, participation indicators, and "X learners completed this" create descriptive norms.

- **Correct norm misperceptions**: Where learners believe struggle is abnormal, show that it's typical. "75% of learners found this section challenging" normalizes difficulty.

- **Create constructive injunctive norms**: Signal what behaviors are valued—asking questions, taking risks, helping peers. Make approval visible through design choices.

- **Leverage social proof carefully**: Social proof can motivate engagement but can also demotivate if learners see others far ahead. Show comparable peers, not just superstars.

- **Build norm-setting communities**: Discussion forums, peer groups, and cohorts create micro-communities where norms can be shaped. Seed these with positive norm models.

### For Educators

- **Make norms explicit**: State expected behaviors clearly—"In this class, questions are valued" or "Everyone struggles with this material at first." Don't assume students infer norms correctly.

- **Correct pluralistic ignorance**: Share (anonymized) data about how many students found material difficult or asked for help. Often, students wrongly believe they're alone in struggling.

- **Model desired norms**: When you share your own struggles, ask questions publicly, and show learning behaviors, you establish norms through modeling.

- **Enlist peer norm-setters**: Early adopters of positive behaviors can establish norms for others. Cultivate and highlight students who ask questions, seek help, and persist.

- **Address toxic norms directly**: If cultures of learned helplessness, competition over collaboration, or stigma around effort exist, address them explicitly. Norms can be changed.

### For Self-Learners

- **Seek accurate norm information**: Don't assume others aren't struggling just because they don't show it. Seek out honest accounts of learning processes from people you admire.

- **Choose your reference group**: The norms you're exposed to depend on who you compare yourself to. Surround yourself with people who normalize effort, questions, and growth.

- **Resist negative social proof**: If peers treat learning as pointless or effort as uncool, recognize these norms as harmful and consciously reject them.

- **Contribute to positive norms**: By sharing your own struggles and questions, you help establish norms that support others. Your visibility shapes others' perceptions.

- **Find learning communities with healthy norms**: Online and offline communities vary widely in their norms. Seek environments where growth, effort, and mutual support are normalized.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Norms just reflect what people do"**
Norms don't just describe behavior—they shape it. Believing something is normal makes it more likely. Norms and behavior exist in a feedback loop.

**"People follow norms mindlessly"**
While norms are influential, people also reason about them. Explicitly discussing norms, why they exist, and whether they serve learners can change their influence.

**"You can't change established norms"**
Norms can shift, especially when visible leaders model new behaviors, when accurate information about actual behavior is shared, and when new behaviors are publicly valued.

**"Positive messaging is always better than norms"**
Descriptive norms (what others do) are often more influential than prescriptive messages (what you should do). Telling students to ask questions is less effective than showing them that most students do ask questions.

## Design Considerations

- **Norms are context-specific**: Norms differ across cultures, institutions, and micro-environments. A norm that works in one context may not transfer. Investigate local norms.

- **Unintended norm signals**: Design choices send norm signals whether intended or not. An empty discussion forum signals that participation isn't normal. Audit for unintended messages.

- **Boomerang effects**: Telling high-performers that they're above average can reduce effort (why try if you're already ahead?). Norms can backfire for those already exceeding them.

- **Privacy concerns**: Making behaviors visible creates norm information but also raises privacy concerns. Balance norm visibility with individual privacy.

- **Norm change takes time**: Established norms are sticky. Changing them requires sustained effort, visible modeling, and patience. Quick interventions may not override deep-seated norms.
